# DSA-practice

Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ and Python

## LeetCode-150
- This is a repository for solutions to my first 150 LeetCode questions
- It covers the following topics:
  1. Arrays and Hashing
  2. Two Pointers
  3. Sliding Window
  4. Stack
  5. Binary Search
  6. Linked Lists
- The repositories contain solutions I came up with while following the list of 150 questions at: neetcode.io/practice

## DSA Implementaions
- This includes a set of Data Strucutres and Algorithms that I wrote out myself in order to help understand how these were implemented
- An attempt was made to follow principles of OOP and to make these implementations as generic as possible
